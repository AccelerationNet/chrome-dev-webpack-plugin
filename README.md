## install

```bash
    npm install --save-dev chrome-dev-webpack-plugin
```

Add the plugin to your webpack configuration file:

```js
//webpack.config.js
var ChromeDevPlugin = require("chrome-dev-webpack-plugin");
var path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  context: path.join(__dirname, "src"),
  entry:  {
    background: [path.join(__dirname, "src", "background.js")],
  },
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "[name].bundle.js"
  },
  plugins: [new ChromeDevPlugin()]
}
```

## Features
This plugin helps streamlining chrome extension development by providing features for maintaining and synchronizing the manifest.json.

### manifest.json
By default the plugin expects a `manifest.json` file to be present in the `context` path. It will generate a new manifest.json in the `output.path`.

### auto completion
The `manifest.json` file doesn't need to be complete. You can omit some of the keys (`name`, `description`, `version`) as long as they are present in the `package.json`.
The missing keys in the `manifest.json` will be filled from the project's `package.json` file.

If the `version` key is filled, the semver notation will be translated to be compliant with chrome's version notation.

### build number
Chrome's versions are composed of up to 4 fields contrarily to the semver notation.

Optionally the 4th field in `version` can be filled with a build number. It can be generated or set manually.

### resources mapping
The plugin will automatically try to map resources with resulting bundles (ex: `background.js` to `background.bundle.js`).

Additionally if a resulting bundle ends-up being optimized (using `webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin`) all the resulting scripts will have the dependency bundles prepended (ex: `['background.js']` to `['vendor.bundle.js', 'background.bundle.js']`).

### example

```js
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "background": {
    "scripts": [
      "background.js" // -> will be translated to "background.bundle.js"
    ]
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": [
        "*://*/*"
      ],
      "js": [
        "content.js" // -> will be translated to "content.bundle.js"
      ]
    }
  ],
  // The plugin will add the following keys from package.json:
  // - "name": "webpack-chrome-dev-plugin-example-default",
  // - "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Options

```js
//webpack.config.js
var ChromeDevPlugin = require("chrome-dev-webpack-plugin");
var path = require("path");

var manifestFile = "manifest.json";
var sourcePath = path.join(__dirname, "src");
var distPath = path.join(__dirname, "dist");
var sourceManifest = path.join(sourcePath, manifestFile); // ./src/manifest.json

var plugins = [
  new ChromeDevPlugin({
    //The source manifest file you want to use for your extension 
    //(defaults to {$context}/"manifest.json")
    entry:sourceManifest,

    //The resulting manifest to emit (defaults to "manifest.json")
    output:manifestFile,
    
    //The package.json file you want to use to sync data from
    package:"./package.json",
    
    //The files in content_scripts[].js and background.scripts will be replaced
    //by the resulting files generated by webpack. See resources mapping.
    map:true,

    //Will use the object passed to the log key for all the logging functions (log, warn, error)
    log:console,
    //Sets the logging functions one by one
    log:console.log,
    warm:console.warn,
    error:console.error,

    //Will set the version to 1.2.3 no matter what the manifest.json and
    //the package.json contains
    version: "1.2.3",

    //Will not stamp the resulting manifest.json version with a build 
    //number (default behavior).
    buildId:false,

    //sets the build number to 10 and disables file and autoIncrement.
    buildId: 10,
    buildId: "10",

    //Will use the file "./.build-id" to read and save the build number.
    //Will also auto-increment the build id for every successfull
    //webpack run.
    buildId:true,
    buildId:".build-id",
    buildId: {
      file:".build-id",
      autoIncrement:true,
    }
  }),
];

module.exports = {
  context: path.resolve(sourcePath),
  entry:  {
    background: [path.join(sourcePath, "background.js")],
  },
  output: {
    path: distPath,
    filename: "[name].bundle.js"
  },
  plugins: plugins
}
```

## options

 - `entry`: the path to the source manifest file (tries to find one if none provided)
 - `output`: the path to the resulting manifest file (defaults to `"manifest.json"`)
 - `package`: the path to the source package.json file (defaults to `"./package.json"`)

### logging

 - `log`: the logging function you would like use. Will override `warn` and `error` if they are not provided. If an objet is passed functions from the object will be used for `log`, `warn` and `error`.
 - `warn`: the logging function you would like use for warnings
 - `error`: the logging function you would like use for errors

### override version
You can completely override the version by specifying a string:

 - `version`: the version number you want to set in your manifest.json (overrides the version found in json files)

### build number
You can choose to stamp the version in your manifest.json with a build number.

To simplify development and deployment the build id can be automatically generated when new files are emitted. First the build Id is read from a file, increased applied and saved. To enable this feature set `buildId` to true, or to a filename.

If you pass a build number instead, the build number will be used as is.
- `buildId`: activates the stamping of the version with a build number. 

```js
config = {
  buildId = process.env.TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER || "./.BUILDID"
}
```

## default manifest.json
If you don't set the `entry` option the plugin will try to find a manifest.json file:

- if another plugin already emits a manifest file (ex:[CopyWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin)) this file will be used as an `entry`. `output` will also be automatically filled if it has not been set.
- otherwise the plugin expects to find a manifest.json file in the `context` path of your project.

## Progress
Here is the status of the features:

- [x] emit a manifest file.
- [x] synchronize the missing mandatory keys in the manifest file from a package.json file.
- [x] if no manifest is given uses the manifest.json emitted by another plugin.
- [x] if no manifest is given uses the one in the context folder if available.
- [x] if no package.json is given uses the package.json found in cwd.
- [x] map all the js files in manifest.json to the resulting compiled bundle files.
- [x] files split with the `webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin` have their dependencies prepended.
- [x] can add a build number to the version key (ex: 1.2.3.9878)
- [x] generate a build number from a file or from a given parameter
- [x] auto increments the build number and saves it to file by default
- [x] examples
- [x] testing with examples

Planned features:

- [ ] automatically add files listed in manifest.json to the build pipeline (if they are not already there).
- [ ] automatically reset the build number if a reset is requested on `major`, `minor`, or `patch` increase.
- [ ] watch for webpack-hot-middleware changes and reload the extension automatically upon hot reload.
